For usage, see

http://www.ardour.org/files/manual/sn-mackie.html

unfortunately it's a bit outdated, so to get the latest manual, go to the manual
directory in the ardour source tree, and say "make html" to build the latest.
Then point your favourite browser at tmp/index.html

NOTES:

* support for alsa/sequencer ports is currently broken. We're working on it.

* you'll need to make port changes in etc/ardour2/ardour_system.rc and
etc/ardour2/ardour.rc, otherwise they don't stay changed in ~/.ardour2/ardour.rc
