<H3>Footswitch</H3>

At least on every footswitch I've tried, the polarity appears to be wrong, in that the footswitch "up" position results
in 0100 being OR'd into the result. Pressing it down results in a 0, if no other keys are pressed. Releasing it results in 0100.

Every other key when up results in 0. This odd behavior would hopefully be controllable via a command to the tranzport,
but I don't have that, so dealing with footswitch events is weird. 

So, seeing this bit enabled would be something like "HAVE_FOOTSWITCH INSTALLED", BE SMART ABOUT IT.


<H3>Special Key Combinations</H3>
<p>
In addition to the normal keycodes generated by the tranzport, it is possible to hit several combinations of keys and get a unique
result. Some are really weird. Perhaps the following assignments make sense:
</p><p>
<table><tr><th>PRESSING</th><th>RESULT</th><th>ASSIGNED TO</th></tr>
<tr><td>TRACKLEFT+TRACKRIGHT</td><td>TRACKLEFT+TRACKRIGHT</td><td>Master</td></tr>
<tr><td>SHIFT+TRACKLEFT+TRACKRIGHT</td><td>SHIFT+TRACKLEFT+TRACKRIGHT+UNDO</td><td>Show Bus Only Toggle</td></tr>
<tr><td>IN+OUT</td><td>IN+OUT</td><td>Zoom 100%</td></tr>
<tr><td>SHIFT+IN+OUT</td><td>SHIFT+IN+OUT+UNDO</td><td>Max Zoom</td></tr>
<tr><td>SHIFT+REW+FFW</td><td>SHIFT+REW+FFW+UNDO</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>RECORD+TRACKSOLO+FOOTSWITCHNOTDEPRESSED</td><td>RECORD+TRACKSOLO+BATTERY</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>PLAY+MUTE</td><td>PLAY+MUTE</td><td></td></tr>
</table>
