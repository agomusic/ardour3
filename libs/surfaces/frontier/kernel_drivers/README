This directory contains the USB Tranzport Kernel driver for Linux.

At present it accepts reads/writes of 8 byte cmds to /dev/tranzport0 to control
the lights and screen.

Reads are possible. Wheel Compression does not currently account for button changes

It also has some sysfs hooks that are non-functional at the moment.

The API is closely tied to the ardour revision and WILL change. 

A sysfs interface is PERFECT for simple userspace apps to do fun things with the
lights and screen. It's fairly lousy for handling input events and very lousy
for watching the state of the shuttle wheel.

In the end this is going to be driven by a midi layer
