This is the unstable version of gtkmm, aimed at Gtk+ 2.0.x.
See CHANGES for a comparison with gtkmm 1.2.

Your unstable development environment
-------------------------------------

Until the GTK+ 2.0 / GNOME 2.0 platform is stable, you should try to separate these unstable libraries from your stable GTK+ 1.2 / GNOME 1.2/1.4 libraries. You can do this by installing the unstable libraries into a different prefix.
e.g. ./configure --prefix=/usr/devgnome2

When using the development libraries, you will need to modify some environment variables. This will be easier if you create a file (e.g. devgnome2) in your home directory that contains these commands:

export PATH="/usr/devgnome2/bin:$PATH"; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/devgnome2/lib" ; export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/devgnome2/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" ;

You can then type
# source devgnome2
to prepare your environment before building or working with the development libraries.

You may also need to edit /etc/ld.so.conf to add /usr/devgnome2/lib, and then type /sbin/ldconfig to re-process the ld.so.conf.


The vicious-build-scripts module in cvs.gnome.org might help you with this, if you can get it to work.

Required Libraries
------------------

* Of course, you will need gtk+ 2 and its dependencies.
* libsigc++ 1.2 (A release, or libsigc++-1.2 from cvs)
