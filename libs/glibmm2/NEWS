  - gmmproc: Allow () in property and signal docuemntation.
  - gmmproc: Do not try to remove a common prefix from the 
  C enam values, if there is no common prefix.
  - enum.pl: Allow whitespace in front of an enum typedef. 
  (Daniel Elstner)
  - enum.pl: Fix an infinite loop.

* ObjectBase: Added connect_property_changed(), 
  as an alternative to use when the property proxies are not 
  available because GLIBMM_PROPERTIES_ENABLED is not defined.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Value: When registering float parameters, use 
  G_MAXFLOAT as the minimum, instead of G_MINFLOAT.
  Likewise for doubles.
  (Oliver Nittka)

2.13.2:

*Build:
 - Fix for api-default-signal-handlers option.
   Bug #357830 (Matt Hoosier)
 - win32: Remove unused source file from Visual Studio project.
   (Cedric Gustin)

2.13.1:

* KeyFile class added, wrapping GKeyFile, 
  for parsing of .ini-style files.
  (Rob Page)
* Added get_user_data_dir(), get_user_config_dir(), and 
  get_user_cache_dir().
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
* Support optional ifdef parameters in the .hg macros, 
  to allow, for instance the --enable-atk=no option, 
  to disable the build and use of the atkmm API, 
  for use in embedded environments.
  (Johannes Schimd, Murray Cuming, Openismus)
* Documentation: 
  - Small ustring reference documentation improvement.
  (Ralf Stephan)

2.12.0:

Changes sinze 2.10:
* Added the --enable-api-default-signal-handlers option, for use in 
  embedded environments that have reduced resources. See configure --help 
  for the other subsets.
* Value: Added init(const GValue*), so we can copy GValue instances 
  of any type at runtime. Needed by the new branch of libgdamm.

2.11.3:

* Build: Added the --enable-api-default-signal-handlers option, for use in 
  embedded environments that have reduced resources. See configure --help 
  for the other subsets.

2.11.2:

* Date: Fix implementation of Glib::Date::set_time_current() so
  that it doesn't set the date to Dec 31, 1969.
  (Jonathon Jongsma)
* Value: Added init(const GValue*), so we can copy GValue instances 
  of any type at runtime. Needed by the new branch of libgdamm.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added a #warning to warn about including X11/Xlib.h before a glibmm header, 
  which would break things. Bug #316726 from Mert Tugcu and Javeed Shaikh.
  (Murray Cumming)
* Build: 
  - Quote some m4 macros to avoid warnings. Bugs (with patches) #347076 
  and #347077
  (Kevin McBride).
  - Fix exporting of get/set_property() on mingw32-gcc.
  (Cedric Gustin)




2.10.1

* Windows Build:
 - Define GLIBMM_DLL when building with mingw32 or cygwin, 
   because it is needed by gtkmm. Bug #309030
 (Cedric Gustin)
* OptionGroup: Allow default values, by not initializing them all.
  (Armin Burgmeier)
* Slight code size reduction by marking private functions as static.
  (Murray Cumming)

2.10.0:

* Windows Build:
 - ustring.h: Tag npos with GLIBMM_API, in order to
   dllexport it on win32. Bug #332438.
 - Updated MSVC++ build files and README, for MS Visual Studio 2005.
 (Cedric Gustin)
* gmmproc code generator: 
 - WRAP_METHOD() Take an extra optional argument: deprecated deprecationtext - 
  so that we can insert the appropriate doxygen tag in the documentation, where 
  the C documentation does not do it for us.

2.9.1:

* Date:
  - Added set_time(time_t), set_time(GTimeVal), and deprecated  
    set_time(GTime)
  - Added set_time_current().
  (Murray Cumming)
* Build: Added --enable-deprecated-api  option. When set to disabled, 
  it does not build deprecated API. This reduces the size of the 
  library, and might be useful for embedded devices.
  (Murray Cumming)

2.8.2:

* Solaris build fix: Correct the detection 
  of make. (Mark Rouchal)

2.8.1:

* Build: Check for glib 2.8.

  introduced in 2.6.0, for now, because it stops some valid uses.
  (Bryan Forbes)

2.6.0:

New stable version. Changes compare to glibmm 2.4.x:

* Added Option, OptionContext, OptionGroup for parsing of command-line arguments.
* Added filename_display_basename() and filename_display_name().
* Added setenv() and unsetenv().
* add_interface() methods will no longer give warnings if you 
  call them twice.
* gmmproc:
  - Now reuses C properties documentation.

2.5.6:

- IRIX MIPSpro 7.4.2m
  (Older versions of all these compilers might also work.)
  (Murray Cumming, www.thewrittenword.com)
* Now builds with MSVC++ .Net 2003 (gtkmm 2.4 already did).
  (Cedric Gustin)
  
2.5.4:

Options:
* Added Option(GOptionGroup* cast_item) constructor,
  needed by Gtk::Main.
* Added reference documentation.
(Murray Cumming)

2.5.3:

* Options:
  - Allow parsing of boolean arguments (arguments with no value).
  - Really use the short names.  
  (Daniel Holbach, Murray Cumming)
* Added filename_display_basename() and filename_display_name().
  (Murray Cumming)
* Added setenv() and unsetenv(). (Murray Cumming)

2.5.1:

* OptionContext, OptionGroup, OptionEntry: Made the add_entry() methods 
  type-safe and fixed several problems memory-management problems. This 
  API is now worth looking at.

2.4.1:

* Build fixes for gcc 3.4.0.
* Doxygen not required when building from tarballs.
  (Murray Cumming)


2.4.0:

Changes since 2.2.0:

* Now separate from gtkmm, so you can use things like Glib::ustring without depending on gtkmm. This glibmm 2.4 API installs in parallel with gtkmm 2.0/2.2, so you can install applications which use either.
* When using pkg-config, you should check for "glibmm-2.4".
* Glib::ObjectBase inherits virtually from SigC::Object, allowing multiple inheritance with other classes that inherit from SigC::Object.
* RefPtr:
  - is_null() was removed, to encourage you to use "== 0" instead.
  - operator=(CppObject*) was removed.
* The gtkmmproc code-generator is now gmmproc, and has several improvements to support gtkmm 2.4.
* Now uses improved libsigc++ 2.0 API.
* Added i18n.h and i18n-lib.h, which include the relevant
  glib headers, which declare internationalization 
  macros such as _().
* New methods:
  Glib::spawn_close_id(), Glib::MainLoop::depth(),
  Glib::Date::clamp_min(),  Glib::Date::clamp_max(). 
* Improved documentation.

 
2.3.8:

* Fix crash when using Glib::Main signals.
  (Martin Schulze)
* Corrected the configure-time SUN compiler check.
  (Murray Cumming, Alexander Nedotsukov)

2.3.7:

* Added configure macros to detect SUN compiler oddities.
* Various SUN Forte C+ and g++ 3.4 (cvs) build fixes.
  (Murray Cumming)
* gmmproc: Improved parsing of C docs.
  (Hagen Moebius)

2.3.6:

* Added i18n.h and i18n-lib.h, which include the relevant
  glib headers, which declare internationalization 
  macros such as _(). (Murray Cumming)
* Added Glib::spawn_close_id(). (Murray Cumming)
* Added Glib::MainLoop::depth(). (Murray Cumming)
* Documentation: corrections to CHANGES (Martin Schulze).
* gmmproc: Can now handle "const const_iterator& iter"
  parameter names without getting confused by 2 consts.
  (Murray Cumming)

2.3.5:

* glibmm now uses libsigc++ 2 rather than libsigc++ 1.2.
 
2.3.4:

* ListHandle/SListHandle (intermediate container types):
  - Added a const_cast<> to allow lists of const elements.
* gmmproc: _WRAP_SIGNAL(): Added optional custom_c_callback 
  parameter.
  (Murray Cumming)
* WIN32: Build fixes, mostly merged from the 2.2 branch.
  (Cedric Gustin) 
 
2.3.3:

* gmmproc (code generator)
  - properties: Make read-only properties have const accessors,
    and add a second read-only const accessor for normal
    properties. Wrap construct-only properties as read-only,
    instead of ignoring them.
  - vfuncs: Really generate const vfuncs when requested. Put
    the method declaration directly into the .h file, so that
    the doxygen documentation can be next to it.
  - documentation:
    - Remove mergecdocs configure option - always
    merge the C docs, to avoid any risk of uploading or
    releasing empty documentation. Just delete the *_docs.xml
    files to make building from cvs faster.
    - Install a GLIBMM_CHECK_PERL() macro, for use by gtkmm
    and other *mm projects, to get the perl path needed by
    doxygen.
    - Install beautify_docs.pl so it can be reused in gtkmm
    and other *mm projects, instead of having lots of copies.
* Glib::ObjectBase: The default constructor, never before used,
  now generates a custom GType, for use when creating new
  implementations of Glib::Interfaces - for instance, see the
  new custom tree model example in gtkmm.
* Glib::Date: Added clamp_min() and clamp_max().
  (Murray Cumming)

* Documentation:
  - Added reference documentation for MainLoop, MainContext, 
    Source, and Date. (Alberto Paro)
  
2.3.2:

* gmmproc (code generator):
  - signal proxies have extra space to avoid << with templates.
  - Added WRAP_METHOD_DOCS_ONLY() for reusing documentation even
    when the method is hand-coded.
  - _WRAP_SIGNAL(): Added optional no_default_handler parameter,
    because some of the new GTK+ signals have no public default 
    handler vfunc.
* Added Glib::init(), for use by non-GUI apps which need to 
  use Glib::wrap().
* PropertyProxy: Can now be used with Interfaces.
* Documentation improvements, so that gtkmm docs link to glibmm
  docs.
  (Murray Cumming)

2.3.1:

* gmmproc changes needed by gtkmm 2.3.0
  (Murray Cumming)
* examples updated and buildable and working,
  without gtkmm code.
  (J. Abelardo Gutierrez)

Changes in glibmm 2.3.0:

* Now separate from gtkmm, so you can use things like Glib::ustring without depending on gtkmm.
  This glibmm 2.4 API installs in parallel with gtkmm 2.0/2.2, so you can install this unstable library 
  without the risk of breaking existing application.
* This does not yet require glib 2.3 because there has been no tarball release of that yet. For now, you
  can use glibmm 2.3.0 with glib 2.2.x.
* When using pkg-config, you should check for "glibmm-2.4".
* Glib::ObjectBase inherits virtually from SigC::Object, allowing multiple inheritance with other
  classes that inherit from SigC::Object.
* RefPtr:
  - is_null() was removed, to encourage you to use "== 0" instead.
  - operator=(CppObject*) was removed.
* gtkmmproc is now gmmproc.
* All the glibmm bugfixes in gtkmm 2.2.x.
