*** Reference documentation.
- Type "make" in docs/reference to generate HTML docs
  from the source code.
- We use Doxygen.
  Doxygen comments: Use either

  /// This does something.
  void something()

  or

  /** This does something
   * It does it like so.
   * @param foo The foo to be somethinged.
   */
  void something(Foo& foo);

  Rememeber to actually look at the documentation before adding these
  comments to the .hg files. It might not be necessary because
  gtkmmproc might do it for you - see the next section.
  
- Reuse of GTK+ documentation:
    When gtkmmproc generates the .h/.cc files from the .hg/.ccg files,
  it inserts doxygen comments based on the gtk-doc comments in the
  GTK+ source code.
    gtkmmproc does this by looking at gtk/src/gtk_docs.xml, which is
  generated occasionally by the pygtk/codegen/docextract_to_xml.py
  python script, in the gnome-python cvs module.

- Overriding the GTK documentation:
    Sometimes the GTK documentation for a functoin is not appropriate
    for the gtkmm method that wraps it. If so, you should add a
    section to gtk/src/gtk_docs_override.xml


*** Book
- The "Programming with gtkmmproc" book is in DocBook XML 4 format.
- Type make in docs/tutorial to build the HTML.
