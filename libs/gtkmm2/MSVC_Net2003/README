Building gtkmm-2.4 with Visual Studio .NET 2003

* You will need Visual Studio .NET 2003 (MSVC 7.1).  Earlier versions of the compiler, including 6.0 and 7.0 will not work.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development Environment from the Glade for Windows project, http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net.
* Build libsigc++ 2.0.6 or later + glibmm 2.4.7 or later from source.
* Add GTK+, libsigc++ and glibmm to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Load the gtkmm/MSVC_Net2003/gtkmm.sln solution.
* Build the entire solution.
* Run the tests.
