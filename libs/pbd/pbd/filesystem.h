/**
 * @namespace PBD::sys
 *
 * The API in this file is intended to be as close as possible to the
 * boost::filesystem API but implementing only the subset of it that is required
 * by ardour using the glib/glibmm file utility functions in the implementation.
 *
 * More information about boost::filesystem and the TR2 proposal at
 *
 * http://www.boost.org/libs/filesystem/doc/tr2_proposal.html
 *
 * Hopefully the boost::filesystem API will pass TR2 review etc and become part
 * of the C++ standard and this code can be removed, or we just end up using
 * the boost filesystem library when it matures a bit more.
 * 
 * My reasons for writing this thin wrapper instead of using glib directly or
 * using boost::filesystem immediately are:
 *
 *  - Using sys::path instead of strings and Glib::build_filename is more
 *    convenient, terse and forces correct platform agnostic path building.
 *
 *  - Using boost::filesystem on windows would mean converting between any UTF-8
 *    encoded strings(such as when selecting a file/directory in the gtk file
 *    chooser) and the native file encoding (UTF-16). It would take some time
 *    and testing to find out when this is required and the glib functions already
 *    do this if necessary.
 *
 *  - Using exceptions to indicate errors is more likely to uncover situations 
 *    where error conditions are being silently ignored(I've already encounted
 *    a few examples of this in the ardour code).
 *
 *  - Many of the glib file utility functions are not wrapped by glibmm so this
 *    also provides what I think is a better API.
 *
 *  - Using boost::filesystem directly means another library dependence and would
 *    require more testing on windows because of the character encoding issue.
 *  
 *  - The boost::filesystem API changes a bit as part of the TR2 review process etc.
