/**
 * \class PluginInputDomainAdapter PluginInputDomainAdapter.h <vamp-sdk/hostext/PluginInputDomainAdapter.h>
 * 
 * PluginInputDomainAdapter is a Vamp plugin adapter that converts
 * time-domain input into frequency-domain input for plugins that need
 * it.  This permits a host to use time- and frequency-domain plugins
 * interchangeably without needing to handle the conversion itself.
 *
 * This adapter uses a basic Hanning windowed FFT that supports
 * power-of-two block sizes only.  If a frequency domain plugin
 * requests a non-power-of-two blocksize, the adapter will adjust it
 * to a nearby power of two instead.  Thus, getPreferredBlockSize()
 * will always return a power of two if the wrapped plugin is a
 * frequency domain one.  If the plugin doesn't accept the adjusted
 * power of two block size, initialise() will fail.
 *
 * The adapter provides no way for the host to discover whether the
 * underlying plugin is actually a time or frequency domain plugin
 * (except that if the preferred block size is not a power of two, it
 * must be a time domain plugin).
 *
 * The FFT implementation is simple and self-contained, but unlikely
 * to be the fastest available: a host can usually do better if it
 * cares enough.
 *
 * In every respect other than its input domain handling, the
 * PluginInputDomainAdapter behaves identically to the plugin that it
 * wraps.  The wrapped plugin will be deleted when the wrapper is
 * deleted.
 *
 * \note This class was introduced in version 1.1 of the Vamp plugin SDK.
