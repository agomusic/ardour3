2.16.0:

2.14.0:

2005-12-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/bpath.ccg:
	* libgnomecanvas/src/bpath.hg: path property: 
	Use GnomeCanvasDef* instead of RefPtr, because that 
	breaks the API less, compared to the previous gpointer.

2005-12-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/bpath.hg: The path property is 
	a PathDef, not a gpointer*. This theoretically breaks 
	API/ABI, but it is useless if we do not change it, 
	because the type is now checked in the C library.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/libgnomecanvas_signals.defs: 
	Update with h2defs.py, but ignoring API-break-causing 
	writable/not-writable changes.
	Bug #320502 by Pau Fernandez.

2005-12-06   Jonathon Jongsma <jonathon.jongsma@gmail.com>

	* configure.in: Look for gmmproc in generic libdir 
	directory, because that is not always lib/. This 
	fixes the build on some 64-bit systems.

2.12.0:

2005-09-07  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com

	* Updated NEWS and increased version.
2.11.1:

2005-06-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com

	* libgnomecanvas/src/item.ccg:
	* libgnomecanvas/src/item.hg: Added get_parent_group() 
	convenience method, so people do not have to use the 
	property.
	* demos/canvas_features.cc:
	* demos/primitives.cc: Use get_parent_group() instead of 
	property_parent().

This is the HEAD branch. The gnome-2-10 is for maintenance of 
libgnomecanvasmm-2.10.x.
 
2005-06-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.hg:
	* libgnomecanvas/src/ellipse.hg:
	* libgnomecanvas/src/group.hg: Removed extra ;s that break 
	the build on SUN Forte CC.

2.10.0:

2005-02-07  Cedric Gustin  <cedric.gustin@swing.be>

	* build_shared/Makefile_build.am_fragment: added a few LDFLAGS 
	for win32 DLLs (defined in win32_dlls_ldflags and appended to 
	common_ldflags).

2005-02-07  Michael Hofmann  <mh21@piware.de>

	* configure.in: Added test of win32 platform and support for
	MS-style bit alignment.
	
2005-02-02  Bradley Bell  <btb@debian.org>

	* libgnomecanvasmm/src/item.ccg: item_construct(): Use an extra 
	helper function to create an empty va_list, instead of passing 0 to 
	gnome_canvas_item_construct(). Needed by the alpha platform. 
	Bug # 136930.
	
2.8.0:
	
2004-09-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@murrayc.com>

	* Increased version for GNOME 2.8 release version.

2.6.1:

2004-05-01  Takashi Takekawa <takekawa@users.sourceforge.jp>
 
         * libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvas.[h,cc] (GNOMEMM_PROPERTY,
         GNOMEMM_PROPERTY_IMPL): fixed doubled '>' when T is a template class,
         for the Intel compiler.
         * libgnomecanvas/src/line.hg: deleted unnecessary namespace
         qualification, for the Intel compiler.

2.6.0:

2004-04-12  Bryan Forbes  <bryan@reigndropsfall.net>

	* tools/extra_defs_gen/Makefile.am: link against the 2.4 release of glibmm.

2.5.2:

2004-04-07  Bryan Forbes  <bryan@reigndropsfall.net>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.hg: changed from using GdkRgbDither to
	Gdk::RgbDither.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/item.hg: changed from using GdkDrawable* to const
	Glib::RefPtr<Gdk::Drawable>&.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/text.hg: changed all C Pango properties to their C++
	counterparts.

2004-02-07  Alexander Nedotsukov <bland@FreeBSD.org>

 	* Fixed m4 files installation directory missed after 2.0 -> 2.6 change.

2.5.1:
 
2004-02-13  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Use the new libsigc++ 2 syntax.

2003-12-21  Eric Bourque <ericb@computer.org>
	* libgnomecanvasmm.spec.in: fixed dependency to gtkmm2 instead of gtkmm

2003-12-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/widget.hg: Use a Gtk::Widget* instead of a
	Gtk::Widget for the widget property.

2.5.0:

2003-11-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* This is now libgnomecanvasmm 2.5, which will become libgnomecanvasmm
	2.6. This is on HEAD, and libgnomecanvasmm 2.0 is on the gnome-2-4
	branch. This uses gtkmm 2.4 and is parallel-installable.

2003-09-25  Eric Bourque <ericb@computer.org>
	* libgnomecanvasmm.spec.in: updated for libgnomecanvasmm-2.0
	
2.0.1:
	
2003-08-22  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* examples/Makefile.am: Fixed the distcheck.


2003-07-21  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.hg: Use the new GMMPROC_PROTECTED_GCLASS
	macro on the Canvas class so that the CanvasAA class can access
	canvas_class_.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.ccg: Rewrite the CanvasAA constructor to 
	use the new (and working) gtkmm2-style construction construction. Fixes
	bug #107686.
	* configure.in: Now requires gtkmm 2.2.5, which has the new macro.

2.0.0:

2002-12-10  Bradley Bell  <btb@debian.org>
	
 	* scripts/Makefile.am: distribute macros.m4
	
2002-12-10  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* Properties: Files renamed to be more conform with the rest,
	moved implementation from header into implementation file,
	some typos fixed, some properties added.

2002-12-09  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>	

	* libgnomecanvas/src/rich-text.[ccg|hg]: Replaced 
	void get_iter_at_location(const Gtk::TextIter&, int, int) with
	iterator get_iter_at_location(int, int) const to be more conform
	with Gtkmm iterator methods.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.[ccg|hg]: The following methods are
	now const: root(), get_scroll_region(), get_center_scroll_region(),
	w2c(), and get_color()
	* libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvasmm/affinetrans.[cc,h]: Changed
	bool operator==(AffineTrans&) to 
	bool operator==(const AffineTrans&) const
	* demos/primitives.cc: Fixed pack_start() Gtk::AttachOptions.
	* examples/Makefile.am_fragment: Was missing in CVS (I took it from
	the release candidate).
	* libgnomecanvas/src/libgnomecanvas_docs_override.xml: Was missing
	in CVS (I took it from the release candidate).

2002-12-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* libgnomecanvas/*.pc.in: Changed LIBS from 1.3 to 2.0.

2002-12-09  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Merging C docs: Added libgnomecavas/src/libgnomecavas_docs.xml and 
	libgnomecanvas_docs_override.xml, and added --mergecdocs to 
	build_shared/Makefile_gensrc.am_fragment
	* examples: Created separated directories for each example, with each
	Makefile.am including examples/Makefile.am_fragment, like the other
	*mm projects. Unlike the other projects, the examples build as part
	of the main build, because there aren't many.

2002-12-09  Murray Cumming <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Increased version to 2.0.0, renamed library from 1.3 to 2.0.

1.3.11:
	
2002-09-28  Owen Stenseth  <owen@bonemachine.org>

	* demos/primitives.cc: Set center_scroll_region to false as the
	libgnomecanvas demo does.
	
1.3.10:
	
2002-08-15  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvasmm/canvas-property.cc
	(Property<Gdk::Color>::set_value_in_object): Clear color property if input string is ""
	(Property<Pango::FontDescription>): Moved implementation to .cc file

1.3.9:
	
2002-08-08  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/shape.hg: 
	* libgnomecanvas/src/line.hg: 
	* libgnomecanvas/src/text.hg: 
	* libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvasmm/canvas-property.h: Changed
	stipple properties to use correct Gdk::Bitmap param type instead
	of Gdk::Pixmap and Gdk::Drawable

2002-07-25  Michael Babcock <mbabcock@la.creatureshop.henson.com>
	* libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvasmm/point.cc: gobj(): Avoid infinite
	recursion.

2002-07-24  Erwin J. van Eijk  <kojak@oakhill.demon.nl>

	* examples/canvas/canvas_events.cc:
	One of the examples, canvas_events caused an infinite recursion
	to occur. I've patched canvas_events to be more like canvas.cc,
	and not to cause the recursion.

2002-07-19  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Updated examples for latest gtkmm pack_start() method.

1.3.8:
	
2002-07-16  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Rebuilt for latest gtkmm.

1.3.7:
	
2002-06-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Rebuilt for latest gtkmm.

1.3.6:
	
2002-06-11  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvasmm.h: Add missing include
	<libgnomecanvasmm/widget.h>
	(#84704, reported by abes@memlab1.ccs.brandeis.edu)

2002-06-02  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/pixbuf.hg (property_pixbuf): Change the
	property type to Glib::RefPtr<Gdk::Pixbuf>.  (Reported by
	Ole Laursen <olau@hardworking.dk>.)

2002-05-14  Daniel Elstner  <daniel.elstner@gmx.net>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/line.hg (Canvas::Points::is_null): Remove
	'virtual' keyword.  There is no need for is_null() to be virtual,
	and gcc-3.1 issues a warning because the dtor isn't virtual too.

	* libgnomecanvas/libgnomecanvasmm/affinetrans.cc: Remove default
	method arguments from the implementation prototype -- gcc-3.1
	doesn't like them at all.  Also, remove the now unnecessary cast
	to std::string in operator<<().

2002-05-14  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* demos/*.cc: Use new Gtk::Box::pack_start() API.
	* configure.in: Require gtkmm version 1.3.14. Require libgnomecanvas
	version 1.113 because of function set_center_scroll_region().

2002-05-07  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* demos/canvas.cc: Use new Gtk::Notebook API.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/line.[ccg|hg]: Add Glib::Value<>
	specialization for Points class.
	* configure.in: Require gtkmm version 1.3.13.
	
1.3.5:
	
2002-04-23  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* generated sources are now distributed. The am_fragments in 
	build_files are now abstracted for all Gnome::Something libraries, 
	so I can now just copy them into the other libraries.

1.3.4:
	
2002-04-04  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* Use new Glib::Value and Glib::PropertyProxy implementation.
	* Use new namespace enums.
	
2002-04-01  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Use new _DEFS() format in *.hg.
	
2002-03-27  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* PathDef: Use new _CLASS_OPAQUE_REFCOUNTED macro instead of
	_CLASS_BOXEDTYPE.

2002-03-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added BoxedType-like methods to Gnome::Points, so that it can
	be used for Properties.

2002-03-16  Murary Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Gnome::Art::AffineTrans and Gnome::Art::Point obj() methods
	renamed to gobj(), to conform to match everything else.

2002-03-15  Andreas Holzmann <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.[hg|ccg] 
	(set_center_scroll_region,
	 get_center_scroll_region): New functions wrapped.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/bpath.[hg|ccg]: New wrapper for GnomeCanvasBpath.
	* libgnomecanvas/src/path-def.[hg|ccg]: New wrapper for 
	GnomeCanvasPathDef.
	* demos/*: Missing curve demos added. More conform to coding standards.

1.3.3:
2002-03-10  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Changed signal args to C++ types.

2002-02-24  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Renamed canvas-*.[h.cc] to *.[h.cc]. They were previously prefixed
	by canvas- to make things clearer when they were part of libgnomeui.
	This means you should probably manually delete any installed 
	libgnomecanvasmm headers or make uninstall a previous version. 

2002-02-24  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* docs/reference generation fixed
	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas.[hg|ccg]:
	  + Antialiased canvas constructor fixed
	  + aa property changed from gulong to bool
	* libgnomecanvas/src/pixbuf.[hg|ccg]: implemented
	* libgnomecanvas/src/rich-text.[hg|ccg]: implemented
	* Added demo, based on the C demo - needs some more
	classes to be implemented.

1.3.2:
	
2002-02-20  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Wrapped remaining methods and signals in Canvas and Item.
	* Art::Affine(const double[6]) constructor is now explicit, and
	the arg is const, with a fixed array size.
	* Increased version number.

2002-02-17  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Removed an if{} check from init(). This would have prevented
	Gnome::Canvas::init() or Gnome::Conf::init() from working after one 
	of them had run first.

2002-02-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Added GnomeCanvasShape wrapper, and corrected RectEllpise and 
	Polygon to inherit from it. 

2002-02-15  Andreas Holzmann  <Andreas.Holzmann@epost.de>

	* Fixed name and description in the pkg-config file.
	* Uncommented Canvas::get_item_at(). Don't know why it was commented.

Release 1:3.1:
	
	vfuncs.defs parsing problems solved. Updated for latest gtkmm
	
Release 1.3.0:

2002-01-08  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* canvas-properties.[h|c]: Properly implemented the shared 
	streams-based properties, using the gtkmm2 PropertyProxy* templates,
	and put them in the Gnome::Canvas::Properties namespace instead of
	Gnome::CanvasHelpers.
	I think that the implementation is much clearer than before.
	We probably need to review the properties in case any streams-based
	properties need to be added.

2002-01-05  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Change properties to normal gtkmm-1.3 properties. The 
	streams-based shared property objects need more work so they 
	can deal with BoxedType and Glib::Object properties. However, this
	streams stuff is separate from normal property proxies.

2002-01-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Canvas::CanvasGroup, Canvas::CanvasItem, etc are now 
	Canvas::Group, Canvas::Item, etc. Canvas::RE is now 
	Canvas::RectEllipse.

2002-01-03  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Moved things into the Gnome::Canvas namespace. We might want to 
	rename things such as Gnome::Canvas::CanvasGroup to 
	Gnome::Canvas::Group.

2002-01-02  ERDI Gergo  <cactus@cactus.rulez.org>

	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas-text.hg:
	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas-polygon.hg:
	* libgnomecanvas/src/canvas-line.hg: Use Gdk::Bitmaps instead of
	Gdk::Pixmaps for stipples

2001-12-15  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Committed Paul Davis's first patch to properly wrap the old
	CanvasItem 'signals' as vfuncs, using his hand-written 
	libgnomecanvas_vfuncs.defs. He also fixed the canvas/canvas 
	example, which now runs.
	* Fixed libgnomecanvasmm.h and added Gnome::canvas_init() which
	should be used before Gtk::Main, if you are not using libgnomeuimm 
	and Gnome::Main.

2001-12-12  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Changed build files to use -I instead of --m4 with
	gtkmmproc, as needed by the latest gtkmm-1.3. The new
	gtkmmproc doesn't seem to be picking up the libgnomecanvasmm
	conversions so I had to comment out a _MEMBER_GET in CanvasItem.

2001-12-11  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Gnome::wrap_init() is now Gnome::canvas_wrap_init()
	to avoid a clash with other wrap_init() functions. This
	requires the latest gtkmm-1.3.

2001-12-04  Murray Cumming  <murrayc@usa.net>

	* Created libgnomecanvasmm for libgnomeui in GNOME2.

The following notes are from gnome-- 1.2.x, which previously
contained the GnomeCanvas wrappers:

Release 1.2.2
  * Gnome::UI::Help fixed: This should be added to the
    Help menu to automatically add items from the
    topics.dat file. (Murray Cumming)
  * gnome-hello example: The About box is now closed
    and deleted when [Close] is clicked
    (Murray Cumming)
	
Release 1.2.1
  * App::create_toolbars fixed to use member UI::Array.
    This allows access to the widgets, as well as
    properly managing memory for the UI Items.
    - menu example modified to demonstrate disabling
      of menu item widgets. (Murray Cumming)
  * configure.in: Don't add -I$prefix/include to
    GNOMEMM_INCLUDEDIR if $prefix=/usr. -I/usr/include
    should never be used because it overrides the order
    of gcc's implicit include path. gtkmm-config.in has
    been corrected too. (Daniel Elstner)
  * Dialog, MessageBox, PropertyBox: Added extra
    documentation so people know that these are not
    self-destructed when run() or run_and_close()
    returns. (Murray Cumming)

Release 1.2.0
  * Canvas example:
      Added example.png to test CanvasImage.
      Items are now deleted in the destructor.
      (Murray Cumming)
  * Reference Documentation:
      Location of perl not hardcoded. (Cedric Gustin)
  * Some gcc 3.0 std namespace fixes. (Claudio Bley)

Release 1.1.21
  * CanvasText: set_font(const GdkFont&) conversion
    fixed and set_font(const string&) added.
    (Murray Cumming)
  * CanvasItem: event signal marshalled again. We lost
    this fix sometime after 1.1.17. (Gergõ Érdi)
  * Uncommented the CanvasHelper::anchor property,
    adding the necessary gtkpacker.h #include.
    (Murray Cumming)
  * Fixed CanvasHelpers::font for Gdk_Font input and
    added a string constructor. (Murray Cumming)
  * Added CanvasText::set_fontset(). (Murray Cumming)

Release 1.1.20
  Unofficial, with some 1.1.21 changes.

Release 1.1.19
  * canvas-property.h is installed.
    (Murray Cumming)

Release 1.1.18
  * Namespace and other fixes for gcc 3.
    (Murray Cumming and Joe Yandle)
  * New Canvas API (KEN)
      Adds streams-style interface. See examples.
  * MDIChild:
      Comments in code.
      Implemented set_config_string(), remove_view(),
      and set_active(). (Murray Cumming)


Release 1.1.17
  * Improved configure checks for Gtkmm and libsigc++.
    (Eric Bourque)
  * App:
    create_menus() and create_toolbar() now
    return UI::Array<>s that provide the widget
    pointers.
    Added insert_menus() and remove_menus().
    Added menu example, to demonstrate access to menu
    item widgets and insert_menus().
    (Murray Cumming)
  * Added Gnome::Pixmap::find_file() as wrapper for
    gnome_pixmap_file(). (Murray Cumming)
  * CanvasItem::event()'s propagation can be stopped by
    returning TRUE in signal handler (Gergõ Érdi)

Release 1.1.16
  * Fixed AppBar default constructor. (Murray Cumming)
  * Improved Point and AffineTrans wrappers. Put them in
    their own point.h/.cc and affinetrans.h/.cc files,
    in the Gnome::Art namespace.
    (Agustin Ferrin Pozuelo)
  * Added canvas_events example. (Agustin Ferrin Pozuelo)
  * Added canvas_affine example. (Agustin Ferrin Pozuelo)
  * configure: fixed check for perl. (Agustin Ferrin Pozuelo)
  * IconList: Removed default constructor. Fixed signals.
    Added selection() method, with SelectionList.
    Added examples.
    (Andreas Holzmann)
  * Canvas, CanvasItem: Changed some pointer args to
    references (Andreas Holzmann).
  * AM_PATH_GNOMEMM() macro installed.
    (Agustin Ferrin Pozuelo)

Release 1.1.15
  * Changed AffineTrans::operator[] to return reference.
    (Falk Hueffner)
  * Examples now quit when close button is clicked,
    instead of just hiding their windows.
    (Murray Cumming)
  * Fixed Clock constructor problems, and
    added demo. (Murray Cumming)
  * CanvasItem sub-classes:
    - Removed default constructors - there's nothing
      in libgnomeui for these.
    - IconTextItem (icon-item.gen_h): Constructors are now
      like other CanvasItems. (Murray Cumming)
  * Fixed Druid constructor problems, and
    added demo. (Murray Cumming)
  * Fixed MessageBox constructor problems, and
    added demo. (Murray Cumming)
  * Fixed Dialog self-destruct by correcting
    close signal wrapping. (Karl Nelson)
  * Dialogs (and sub-classes) now use close_hides()
    as default, to prevent self-destruction.
    (Murray Cumming)
  * Reference documentation now builds
    (Murray Cumming)
   * Fixes to app-helper to allow Slot1<void,Gtk::Widget*> and
      Slot0<void> on UI::Info items. (Karl Nelson)
