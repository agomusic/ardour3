	start not-assigned error in ensure_selection().

2001-10-26  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor.cc (Editor): use scroll timeut whenever the
	editor is active, instead of stopping and starting it.

2001-10-23  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/mixer_strip.cc (update_diskstream_display):
	rationalize rec_enable button handling to be equivalent to same
	code elswhere.

	* gtk_ardour/trackview.cc (record_enable_blink): add rec enable button

	* gtk_ardour/ardour_ui.cc (start_clocking): use SigC::Signals for
	Clock and Blink updates

	* gtk_ardour/marker.cc (set_position): fixed persistent error in
	marker location, caused by not taking the shift into account
	whenever the position was reset.

	* gtk_ardour/editor.cc (initialize_canvas): make the playhead
	cursor sit above the edit cursor.

2001-10-20  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_ops.cc (ensure_selection): make
	add_location_from_selection work again (now ensure_selection()
	works again).

	* ardour_ui.rc: added styles for new rulers.

	* gtk_ardour/regionview.cc (move_to): make gain control points be
	rects

2001-10-19  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/regionview.cc (ControlPoint): change colors of gain curves

	* massively split up editor code to try to produce more
	rapidly-compilable compilation units.

2001-10-17  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_mouse.cc (start_grab): clean up start grab
	code, and make playhead cursor grab stop the transport, restarting
	it again when done.

	* gtk_ardour/ardour_ui.cc (add_diskstream): try to make recorder
	window the correct size.
	

2001-10-13  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/diskstream_ui.cc (DiskStream_UI): make sure that all
	input buttons are the same width, regardless of their label contents.

2001-10-05  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_mouse.cc (button_release_handler): button2 on
	a RegionItem always mutes/unmutes/raises/lowers, regardless of
	mouse mode.

2001-10-04  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_mouse.cc (region_drag_motion_callback): edit
	clock reflect region sync point rather than cursor during drag.
	(button_release_handler): button press/release on cursors +
	markers always initiate a grab, regardless of mouse mode.

	* gtk_ardour/editor.cc (track_canvas_allocate): return the edit
	cursor to a full height line.

	* gtk_ardour/grouped_buttons.cc (GroupedButtons): backpedalled
	from this being a GTK widget to just a C++ object that manipulates
	a set of buttons.

	* gtk_ardour/trackview.cc (set_height): put edit controls in their
	own event window so that we can control color, etc.

	* gtk_ardour/canvas-simplerect.c (gtk_canvas_simplerect_render):
	don't draw vertical lines at end of box (kludge!)

	* gtk_ardour/editor.cc (add_region_to_region_display): copy
	Regions before putting them in the Region list. this prevents
        playlist-edits from altering the state of the "original".		

2001-10-03  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_ops.cc (split_region): operate only on the
	uppermost region, not all those stacked at this location.

2001-09-30  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_mouse.cc (start_grab): don't raise the grabbed
	item to the top of the canvas stack. it must already have been
	visible, so don't do this - it confuses regionview stacking.

2001-09-28  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/marker.cc (Marker): center marker shape on the actual
	location; use frame position rather than canvas position in API.

	* gtk_ardour/streamview.cc (StreamView): add a simplerect to show
	the edge of the track *and* to help us get canvas events for the
	track in areas where there is no region.

	* gtk_ardour/editor_ops.cc (soundfile_chosen_for_insert): make
	insert_sndfile() work again, including a working ensure_cursor()

	* gtk_ardour/marker.cc (Marker): add black outline around marker shapes

2001-09-27  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_ops.cc: implement partial support for nudge variations

	* gtk_ardour/editor_mouse.cc (start_selection): add initial
	support for mouse-based selection.

	* gtk_ardour/editor.cc (Editor): add support for GUI control of

	* gtk_ardour/editor_keys.cc (install_keybindings): add KP_{6,4}
	since we don't get KP_{Right,Left} by default.

	* gtk_ardour/ardour_ui.cc (add_diskstream): put recorder stuff
	(meters, etc) in a separate window.

	* gtk_ardour/plugin_ui.cc (build_control_ui): fix problem with
	destructor logic that caused double destruction of
	ControlUIs. also use Gtk-- functions for PluginUIadjustment.

	more keybindings for the editor.

2001-09-25  Paul Davis  <pbd>

	* gtk_ardour/editor_mouse.cc (region_drag_motion_callback): fixed
	segv caused by referencing a null drag_info.last_trackview
	pointer. this occured when the mouse moved into an area where
        no trackview was, and then back again.		

	* gtk_ardour/marker.cc: added initial support for Canvas-based markers

	* gtk_ardour/keyboard_target.cc (translate_key_name):
	differentiate between Alt and Meta, and Alt(R|L) and Meta(R|L)
