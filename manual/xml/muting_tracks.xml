    in the &TRACK_CONTROLS; or the <guibutton>mute</guibutton> button in a

    <para>
      Muting an Audio Track may slightly reduce the amount of
      <glossterm linkend="gt-dsp">DSP</glossterm> resources required for the
      session but the audio data referenced by the tracks &PLAYLIST; will
      still be read from disk.
