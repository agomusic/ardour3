	<title>Configuring USB device access (Linux only)</title>
	<para>
		Linux is by default a multi-user system, so it has to have a policy to
		determine who can access various devices. This includes those that can be
		plugged into to a USB port.
	</para>

	<para>
		For devices known to the operating system (which these days includes most
		digital cameras, scanners, MIDI interfaces etc.), a logged-in user will be
		granted access automatically. However, for devices that the OS doesn't
		recognize (even if there is software on it that can use it), this is not the
		case. It is possible to configure Linux to reverse this policy and grant all
		users access to all devices, but this is not recommended for security
		reasons.

		<title>Configuring Access to a Frontier Design Tranzport</title>
		<para>
			Using the Tranzport on Linux requires a couple of extra steps to enable
			non-administrative users to access the device.
		</para>

		<para>
			First, you need to login as the administrative user ("root"). Then put the
			following into a new file called <filename>/etc/hotplug/usb/tranzport</filename>
		</para>
<screen>
#!/bin/sh

if [ $ACTION = "add" ] &amp;&amp; [ -f $DEVICE ] ; then
    chmod 0666 $DEVICE
fi
exit 0
</screen>
		<para>
			Then make sure that the file is executable by running
		</para>
<screen>
chmod +x /etc/hotplug/usb/tranzport
</screen>
		<para>
			Second, edit the file <filename>/etc/hotplug/usb.usermap</filename>  by adding the following 2
			lines to the end of it (make sure that the 2nd line is not split across
			multiple lines, even though it is very long):
		</para>

# Frontier Design Tranzport
tranzport            0x0000      0x165b   0x8101    0x0000       0x0000      0x00         0x00            0x00            0x00          0x00               0x00               0x00000000
</screen>
		<para>
			After doing these steps, the next time you plugin your Tranzport it will be
			accessible to you as a regular user.
