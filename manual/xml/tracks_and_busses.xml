  <title>Tracks and Busses</title>
  <para>
    This chapter covers basic management of tracks. Tracks are probably the
    most important objects in Ardour. They represent the fundamental way to
    playback and record audio, MIDI, and image data.

    <title>Hiding Tracks</title>
    <para>
      The track list on the left edge of the Editor and Mixer can be used to
      hide or show specific tracks in either or both of those two windows.
      To hide a track, click to on the tracks name in the relevant track
      list. To show a track, click on its name in the track list. Visible
      tracks have their names shown in cyan, hidden ones in orange.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can also hide any track by clicking its hide button
      (images/hidebutton.ps).
    </para>

    <para>
      Hiding a track in the Editor has no effect on its visibility in the
      Mixer, and vice versa. Hiding a track in one or both windows does not
      affect the playback of that track's material.

        Tracks may be reordered by clicking on their name in one of the
        track lists and dragging it to a new position in the list. Note that

        order in the mixer.
