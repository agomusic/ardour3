		<para>
			The owners of VST (Steinberg Technologies, now owned by Yamaha) give VST
			away to developers for free. Sounds great, but they do not those same
			developers the ability to pass what they get from Steinberg on to other
			developers.
		</para>

		<para>
			This conflicts with the terms of the license for Ardour and several
			software libraries used by Ardour. Steinberg have said quite often that
			they are not opposed in principle to changing their license to allow
			redistribution, but as of mid-summer 2006, it has not happened yet.
		</para>

		<para>
			All of this means that it is <emphasis>illegal</emphasis> for anyone to
			distribute a binary (ready-to-run) version of Ardour with support for VST
			plugins built in. If you want to use Ardour with VST plugins, you must
			<emphasis>compile it yourself</emphasis>.
		</para>

		<para>
			This is not a trivial undertaking; see our
			<emphasis>build page</emphasis>
			for a full explanation even without VST support. This page documents some
			more required steps for the build if you want to include VST support.
