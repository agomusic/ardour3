  <title>Cleaning up a Session</title>

  <para>
    Cleanup looks for audio files that were recorded by ardour for this
    session, but are no longer in use. "In use" means "present in any
    playlist in any snapshot of the session". If you have unused playlists
    (e.g. alternate takes) cleanup will volunteer to delete them for you.
    then it will search all snapshots (including the one you are working
    with), and move all unused captured audio files into the "dead_sounds"
    directory within the session. At this point, you could still potentially
    get material that was "cleaned up" back, though its quite tricky to do.

  <para>
    It is advisable, even <emphasis>firmly recommended</emphasis> that after
    this cleanup step, you save the session, exit ardour and restart. This
    will enable you to confirm that the session still works as expected. If
    all goes well (and it should), you can then do the 2nd phase cleanup,
    which will remove the files from the <filename>dead_sounds</filename>
    directory (at which point, the material is not recoverable without
    backups on your part).
  </para>

  <para>
    Note that the presence of snapshots can cause user confusion, as in "why
    didnâ€™t cleanup do anything?" The answer is frequently that there are
    all capture audio files are in use in this snapshot or in others.
