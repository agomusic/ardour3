  <title>The Mixer</title>
  <para>
    The mixer window provides a view of the session that mimics a
    traditional hardware mixing console. Rather than focusing on the
    arranging of regions along a timeline, the mixer is designed to allow
    you to manipulate the signal flow elements of a session - gain control,
    plugins, bussing and so forth.
  </para>

  <para>
    The left area of the mixer contains three small vertical panes which
    allow various operations to be made on the larger area, which of course
    represents a mixing console.
  </para>

  <para>
    The lines that outline the three smaller panes all have a small square
    near their vertices. This square can be used to resize the four panes
    that form the mixer window. Dragging each of these squares with the left
    mouse button will move the border.

      <title> Group List </title>
      <para>
        The group list pane provides an interface to create and control the
        state of the mix groups present on the mixer. Mix groups provide a
        method of linking faders together, so that a movement on one fader
        will translate to all the other faders in the group.
      </para>

      <para>
        A new session will contail one group, called all. This preset group
        refers to all mixer strips?? <emphasis>what is 'all' doing
        here?</emphasis> Any new groups you create will be listed in this
        pane. Left clicking the <guibutton>Mix Groups</guibutton> button
        will open a window titled <literal>Name for a new mix
        group</literal>, which contains a dark text area. Enter a name for
        your new mix group in the text area. Left clicking
        <guibutton>cancel</guibutton> will close the <literal>Name for a new
        mix group</literal> window. The group list will be unaffected. Left
        clicking <guibutton>OK</guibutton> will create a new mix group. The
        new group will be listed in the group list pane with an empty box
        next to it's name. All mixer strips will now contain the name of the
        new group in their <guibutton>group</guibutton> button. Selecting
        the new group in a mixer strip will assign control of that channel's
        gain fader to the selected group, but <emphasis>only if the group is
        active</emphasis>. Left clicking the box next to the group name will
        activate the group.
      </para>

      <para>
        At the bottom right of the group list, a square box provides a
        method for resizing the pane. Holding down the left mouse button
        while dragging the square vertically will move the lower border of
        the group list.
