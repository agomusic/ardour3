  <title>Edit Group List</title>
  <para>
    Below the track list is the edit group list, which lists all edit groups
    for the session, including a default group called &#8220;all&#8221;. To
    the left of each group name is a checkbox which indicates whether or not
    the group is active (a checkmark means its active). Click on the
    checkbox to change the active status of an edit group.
  </para>

  <para>
    The edit group list can also be used to toggle the visibility of all
    members of the group. Visible edit groups are displayed in cyan, hidden
    ones in orange. Click on the name of the edit group to toggle its
    visibility. Note that an edit group can be visible and yet have hidden
    member tracks, and vice versa.
