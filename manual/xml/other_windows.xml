<section id="sn-other-windows">
	<title>Other Windows</title>
	<para>
		This page summarises various windows you will find in your travels through
		Ardour that aren't available from the <guimenuitem>windows</guimenuitem>
		menu in the editor. They aren't available because they are specific to a
		particular object, like a mixer strip, and are launched from the object
		itself.
	</para>

	<section id="input-output-connections-editor">
		<title>Input/Output Connections Editor</title>
		<para>
			Selecting <guimenuitem>edit</guimenuitem> from the input drop-down menu on
			a mixer strip will open this window, as will selecting
			<guimenuitem>edit</guimenuitem> from the output button. The Input/Output
			connections editor is one of the strangest interfaces known to man. After a
			small amount of use, however, you will find it quite natural to use.
			Because these two windows are identical except for 'input' being transposed
			with 'output', we will cover the Input Connections Editor here and leave it
			up to your imaginative self to work out what it all means in the output
			window.
		</para>

		<para>
			When the window opens, you will be see that it is divided into two main
			areas marked <guilabel>Inputs</guilabel> and <guilabel>Available
			Connections</guilabel> . A third area contains buttons marked
			<guibutton>rescan</guibutton>, <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and
			<guibutton>Cancel</guibutton>.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <guilabel>Inputs</guilabel> area has two buttons marked <guibutton>add
			input</guibutton> and <guibutton>clear connections</guibutton>. The
			<guibutton>add input</guibutton> button adds an audio stream to the mixer
			strip.
		</para>

		<para>
			In other words, if you currently have a two input channel, pressing
			<guibutton>add input</guibutton> will make it a three input channel. If you
			subsequently record on the corresponding track, each region will comprise
			of three channels of audio taken from the inputs you have set in the area
			below.
		</para>

		<para>
			Pressing <guibutton>clear connections</guibutton> will remove all
			connections you have assigned in the area below.
		</para>

		<para>
			Speaking of "the area below", if you've used a template to create your new
			session with, the input fields will aready be filled in with default values
			that are determined by the number of channels your hardware supports. It
			should be noted that by default, inputs are initially set to hardware
			ports, as presumably you will be recording from a hardware device
			initially. This doesn't indicate a preference on Ardour's part, as software
			inputs are just as valid to Ardour as hardware ones.
		</para>

		<para>
			Anyway, in "the area below", notice that one input (probably labelled
			<literal>in 1</literal>) is a lighter colour than the other. If you only
			have one input at the moment, press <guibutton>add input</guibutton> just
			to see the difference. You can remove an input by holding the control key
			while right-clicking on the input name.
		</para>

		<para>
			The lighter coloured input is the one that will be added to when an output
			in the <guilabel>Available connections</guilabel> area is clicked. If the
			wrong input is highlighted, you can highlight the correct one by
			left-clicking the text of the input name you desire.
		</para>

		<para>
			Note that you can "mux" as many inputs together as you like when doing
			this, they just pile up on top of the last one. Be warned, though, that
			they are all summed at unity gain. You can reach some fairly astonishing
			levels by doing this a lot.
		</para>

		<para>
			If you click an output from the <guilabel>Available connections</guilabel>
			area, the connection is added to that input's list, the connection is made
			active, and the next input is made a lighter colour, indicating that it is
			ready to accept your selection. This makes it a simple matter to assign
			many connections rapidly. The transport does not have to be stopped to
			change inputs or outputs (or anything, really) in Ardour.
		</para>

		<para>
			Removing assignments is achieved by left-clicking the relevant output in
			the <guilabel>inputs</guilabel> area. As with most objects in Ardour, you
			can also remove an assignment by holding the shift key while right-clicking
			it.
		</para>

		<para>
			The Available connections area lists all available connections, sorted into
			tabs which represent their associated hardware or software ports. The front
			tab is always <literal>alsa_pcm</literal>. this represents the physical
			ports on your computer. It should contain as many ports as hour hardware
			has inputs.
		</para>

		<para>
			The next tab is Ardour. This tab lists all the connections that Ardour has
			available, including inserts and sends. If you have some other Jack aware
			programs running, they will be given tabs in this area which will
			correspond to their Jack output ports.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <guibutton>rescan</guibutton> button searches for any new available
			outputs. It may be necessary to use it if you have started a Jack
			application after you open the window.
		</para>

		<para>
			The <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> button closes the window <emphasis>XXX
			what really happens?</emphasis> , as does the <guibutton>OK</guibutton>
			button.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="ladspa-plugin-window">
		<title>The LADSPA Plugin Window</title>
		<para>
			This window opens when you double-left-click or control right-click a
			plugin on a mixer strip. It allows you to adjust, store and automate the
			controls presented by any LADSPA plugin. Because LADSPA plugins do not
			contain graphical interface information, this window adapts itself to suit
			the various controls presented by the plugin. The advantage of this system
			is that each plugin appears consistently within Ardour. The disadvantage is
			that with a few plugins, the controls seem to be laid out in a haphazard
			fashion. This is not usually the case, however.
		</para>

		<para>
			Each plugin window will have a <guibutton>bypass</guibutton> switch in the
			top left. Whenever you add a plugin, it's initial state will be bypass. The
			button will be red and appear depressed. To activate the plugin, press the
			<guibutton>bypass</guibutton> button. you should immediately hear the
			plugin inserted in the signal path. All plugins that report their latency
			are automatically time compensated sample-accurately.
		</para>

		<para>
			To the left of the bypass switch you will see the name of the plugin, the
			author and the number of inputs and outputs that the plugin makes use of.
			To the right will be a text entry area, a list selector and a
			<guibutton>Save</guibutton> button. To save a combination of settings,
			press the <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button. A window will appear asking
			for the name of the preset. Enter a name, press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>,
			and your new preset will appear on the list of saved settings.
		</para>

		<para>
			To restore a saved preset, select it from the list. The settings should
			immediately be restored as you release the mouse button.
		</para>

		<para>
			The rest of the window consists of sliders and buttons which represent the
			various controls available for the plugin. To move a slider, left click it
			and slide the mouse horizontally over the range of the control. You can see
			the numeric value and the bar change as you move the mouse. You can also
			press the control key while moving for finer adjustments.
		</para>

		<para>
			Next to each control is an automation mode button. The default state is
			<guimenuitem>off</guimenuitem>. To write automation information, press the
			button and select <guimenuitem>write</guimenuitem> from the drop-down list.
			After engaging the transport, movement of the control will be recorded for
			playback when the <guimenuitem>play</guimenuitem> automation mode is
			selected. <guimenuitem>Touch</guimenuitem> mode automatically switches from
			<guimenuitem>play</guimenuitem> to <guimenuitem>write</guimenuitem> as the
			control is first selected with the mouse button and released, respectively.
			The automation data is accessible from the editor window, along with the
			other automation data for the track.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="export-window">
		<title>The Export Window</title>
		<para>
			The export window appears when either <guimenuitem>export session to
			audiofile</guimenuitem> or <guimenuitem>export range to
			audiofile</guimenuitem> have been selected from the session menu. This
			window enables an audio file to be rendered from either the master bus or
			individual tracks in freewheel mode. A large range of audio file formats
			are supported, as is the ability to export a CUE or TOC file representing
			any CD index or track markers you may have in the session. Bit depth
			reduction can be performed with three types of dither, or no dither.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="crossfade-editor-window">
		<title>The Crossfade Editor Window</title>
		<para>
			The crossfade editor will appear whenever you select <menuchoice>
			<guimenu>crossfade</guimenu> <guisubmenu>edit</guisubmenu> </menuchoice>
			from any active or inactive crossfade in the editor window. This window
			allows you to customise the default crossfade that is automatically applied
			when two regions overlap. Provision is made for auditioning different
			elements of the crossfade, or the crossfade as a whole.
		</para>
	</section>

	<section id="locations-window">
		<title>the Locations Window</title>
		<para>
			The locations window provides a means to locate to and define points and
			ranges in your session. Points and ranges may also be 'promoted' to be CD
			Index or CD Track markers, respectively. Once promoted, they may be
			exported to a standard T.O.C. or CUE file along with the exported audio
			using the export window. The locations window will appear when <menuchoice>
			<guimenu>windows</guimenu> <guisubmenu>locations</guisubmenu> </menuchoice>
			is selected from the editor window.
