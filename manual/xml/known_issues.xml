		<title> Known Issues </title>
		<para>
			This section documents known issues with the all versions of Ardour up to
			and including 1.0. It is not a replacement for our
			<ulink url="http://tracker.ardour.org/">bug tracking system</ulink>, but
			instead summarizes some known issues that are likely to be encountered by
			users and are not in the process of being fixed.

					creating 3rd level feedback loops (e.g. bus 1 feeds bus 2 feeds bus 3;

					ardour's interpretation of "beats per minute" is different from most
					other programs and from convention. 1 "beat" is whatever the meter in
					effect defines. Thus, 120 bpm in a 4/4 meter is 120 quarter notes per
					minute; 120 bpm in a 3/8 meter is 120 eighth notes per minute.

					copying or cut-n-pasting two (or more) regions that have a crossfade
					between them to a new location or a new track does not copy the
					crossfade. Until a future version of Ardour changes this, you are advised
					to do region editing first, and create crossfades second.

					it is not possible to create pan automation control points using the
					mouse for stereo (or higher channel count) tracks and busses. you can
					create automation for these configurations by recording panning motion,
					and you can edit the data using the mouse.

					when importing an audio file directly into a track, there are no choices
					for the quality level of any necessary sample rate conversion. On any
					system that Ardour is running on, there is almost certainly a utility
					called <command>sndfile-resample</command> which uses the same sample
					rate conversion library as Ardour. This utility offers a great deal of
					control over the sample rate conversion process, including quality
					levels. Ardour uses the "best" quality internally. If you want a
					different quality, you can use this tool to produce a rate-converted file
					at the correct speed, and then import that into Ardour.

					when timestretch is used to alter the length of a region, any
					region-specific gain envelope is lost. The new region has the default
					unity gain throughout its duration.

				<para>
					if you overdub on a playlist in an area containing cross-fades, the
					cross-fades will still be audible in spite of the newly overdubbed
					material being "on top" of them. Workaround is to mute or remove the
					crossfades before overdubbing. As a corollary to this, creating
					crossfades that span other crossfades will not work correctly in this
					version of Ardour.
