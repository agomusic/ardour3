  <title>Basic Editing</title>
  <para>
    Once you have recorded or imported the material that will make up a
    session/piece/composition, it will generally become time to
    <emphasis>edit</emphasis> it. You can add/remove material at any time,
    and/or modify the mix if you desire. But editing tends to be a distinct
    focus during the "middle" part of working on an arrangement, and has its
    own particular set of tools and approaches. This section of the manual
    covers the editing tools you will probably use all the time; see
    <xref linkend="ch-advanced-editing"/> for coverage of more specialized
    tools and techniques.
