    It is very important that you check your system is connected and
    configured correctly before attempting to record. See Hardware
    Installation for more information on this topic.

    <para>
      It is of course possible to use Ardour on a single-disk system, but
      you are more likely to have performance problems this way.
    </para>

    <para>
      If you have more than one disk available, we highly recommend using
      one "system" disk and one or more "audio" disks.
    </para>

    <section id="using-the-system-disk">
      <title>Using the system disk </title>
      <para>
        The "system" disk is the main disk on which your operating system
        and (usually) all your installed software reside.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you have any other disks available, it is usually
        <emphasis>not</emphasis> advisable to put your Ardour session and
        all its soundfiles on the main system disk. The reason is that this
        disk may be used at any time by the OS or other programs and, if
        Ardour is trying to play a large amount of disk data at that moment,
        in the worst case this can cause Ardour's playback to stop
        completely. (insert screenshot of error dialog here)
      </para>

      <para>
        Even so, if you have only two disks (the system disk and your audio
        disk), it is possible that a large session will reach the
        performance limits of a single dedicated audio disk. In this case,
        it may be better to put some audio data on the system disk as
        described in the Soft RAID section below.

          You can of course use a normal RAID disk array to spread data
          across multiple disks. This is beyond the scope of this manual.

        <title>Ardour's "Soft" RAID Path</title>
        <para>
          It is possible to spread the resources for your Ardour session
          across multiple disks. This can increase the number of tracks or
          regions you can work with at once.
        </para>

        <para>
          There is no reason to do this if your computer has only one disk.
        </para>

        <para>
          To use the "soft RAID" feature, manually create a new directory on
          another disk. Open the Options Editor window. Click on the
          Paths/Files tab. In the "session RAID path" text box, you will see
          that the default value is the path to the directory where your
          current session lives. But this Session RAID Path can actually be
          a colon-separated list of directories. To add your new directory
          to this list, type a single colon after the existing Session RAID
          Path, followed by the full path to the new directory. Ardour will
          now record new tracks to either directory. (question: how does
          ardour decide which files go where?)
        </para>

        <para>
          You can squeeze some more disk performance out of an existing
          session by following the above procedure, then manually moving
          some files from the
          <code>sounds/</code>
          subdirectory of the existing session into a
          <code>sounds/</code>
          subdirectory of your new directory. Be very careful when doing
          this! If you accidentally delete these sound files, Ardour cannot
          magically fix it for you.
        </para>

        <note>
          <para>
            If you use the "soft" RAID feature described above, take care to
            remember this when making and restoring session backups! You
            will not be happy if you forget to back up one of your data
            directories; and restoring a backup won't work if you don't make
            sure that the "Session RAID Path" setting corresponds to the
            directories where you actually put the restored files.

      <para>
        When creating tracks, there are 2 different options: Normal tracks
        and Tape tracks. Tape tracks implement a "destructive" style of
        recording that is useful when you will be making multiple recordings
        to the same track, and you don't want to keep a separate "region" on
        disk for each take. There is no undo function (yet) and there is no
        way to edit a tape track (yet). So what is this good for? Well,
        consider the case where you are doing a final mixdown of a project.
        You could record-enable two Tape tracks, and send the master bus
        output to these tracks. Every time you play through a section of the
        project, the resulting mix will be recorded onto the continuous tape
        track. Once you reach the end of the project, you can send the
        resultant wav file directly to the next production step. There is no
        "rendering" step required. The utility of this increases when you
        are using an outboard, automated mixer. This type of recording is
        very common on a film dubbing stage.
