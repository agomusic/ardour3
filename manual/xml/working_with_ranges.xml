    <title>Bounce Range</title>
    <para>
      Currently, when bouncing a range to disk, files corresponding to each
      channel of the range's output are created. The file names begin with
      Audio, then the track number followed by ".1." Then, a 0 or 1 is
      added, depending on the channel. Finally, the file extension is added.
      The file type is determined by the native format selection in the
      options editor (the Paths/Files tab).
    </para>

    <para>
      In a future version, "bounce range" will replace the range with a new
      region based on the bounced audio file which will include track FX,
      etc. Currently, no dialog box is offered to allow the user to name the
      bounced file or choose its location on disk. The bounced audio is just
      placed in the sounds directory of the project directory. There is
      currently no visual feedback that the bounce has been accomplished.
