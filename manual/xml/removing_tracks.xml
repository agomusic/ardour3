    A track can be removed from within the
    <link linkend="sn-editor-window">Editor Window</link> by right-clicking
    in the empty space in the <link linkend="track-controls">Track
    Controls</link> to bring up the track context menu and choosing
    <guimenuitem>Remove</guimenuitem>.

  <para>
    Alternatively a track can also be removed from within the
    <link linkend="sn-mixer-window">Mixer Window</link> by clicking on the

  <note>
    <para>
      Removing a track is a permanent operation that cannot be undone. If
      there are no other tracks using the
      <glossterm linkend="gt-playlist">playlist</glossterm> that is in use
      by the track being removed then the playlist will also be removed from
      the session and will no longer be accessible.
