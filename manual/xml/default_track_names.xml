  <para>
    When a track is added to the session it is given a default name based on
    the Track type. For example, the first audio track that is added to the
    session will be given the name <literal>Audio 1</literal> and the first
    bus will be called <literal>Bus 1</literal> and any subsequently added
    tracks will be consecutively numbered.
  </para>

  <para>
    Track names determine the names of the files created when recording to a
    track so it is suggested that meaningful names are given to tracks, see
    <xref linkend="renaming-tracks"/>
