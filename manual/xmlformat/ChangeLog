Version 1.04 (released 2006-08-14)
- Assign each token an input line number and display the line number in
  error messages.  This provides better information to the user about
  the location of problems in input files.
- Print the token stack when an error occurs.  This provides some idea of
  the context of the element that is malformed or has malformed content.

Version 1.03 (released 2004-03-26)
- In xmlformat.rb, made some changes needed for Ruby 1.8:
  - Convert @@xml_spe parsing expression to Regexp with Regexp.new().
    scan() method doesn't work with string argument now, apparently.
  - In parsing patterns, change literal ] to \\] to suppress warnings
- In xmlformat.pl:
  - In parsing patterns, change literal ] to \\]. This isn't actually
    necessary, but better preserves parallelism with Ruby version.

Version 1.02 (released 2004-02-06)
- Added --in-place/-i option for in-place reformatting. (Requires named
  input file or files.)
- Added --backup/-b option for making backup of each input file (used with
  --in-place).
- If multiple input files are named on the command line, they are processed
  as separate documents, not as one combined input. (This was necessary
  to make --in-place and --backup work correctly.)
- Added a tutorial document.

Version 1.01 (released 2004-01-18)
- Initial public release.
