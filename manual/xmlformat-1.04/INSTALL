There are two versions of xmlformat:

- xmlformat.rb, written in Ruby
- xmlformat.pl, written in Perl

Both should produce identical results.

To install xmlformat, copy the version you want to use to some public
directory that is listed in your PATH variable.  You may wish to rename
the script to xmlformat so that you don't have to type the .rb or .pl
extension each time you invoke it.

Example:

    cp xmlformat.rb /usr/local/bin/xmlformat
(or)
    cp xmlformat.pl /usr/local/bin/xmlformat

If you want to install both versions, do not rename them:

    cp xmlformat.rb /usr/local/bin/xmlformat.rb
    cp xmlformat.pl /usr/local/bin/xmlformat.pl

In this case you will need to specify the extension when invoking the program
to indicate which version you want.

If your Ruby or Perl programs are not at the location listed in the
first line of the installed script, you'll need to edit that line
to have the correct location.
