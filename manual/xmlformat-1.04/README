xmlformat is free software, distributed under a BSD-style license.
For specific licensing information, see the LICENSE file.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.  xmlformat has two
implementations, one in Ruby and one in Perl.  They should produce
identical output in all cases.

Documentation is in the docs subdirectory.

Tests are in the tests directory, though you run them in the main
xmlformat directory:
- To run all tests:
	make test
- To run all tests for the Ruby version:
	./runtest all
- To run all tests for the Perl version:
	./runtest -p all
- To run an individual test for the Ruby version:
	./runtest testname
- To run an individual test for the Perl version:
	./runtest -p testname

A test name is the name of its .xml file, minus the .xml suffix.
For more information, see tests/Notes.
