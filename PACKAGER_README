(1) VST SUPPORT

You may not distribute binaries of Ardour with VST support. Doing so
is a violation of the license agreement for the Steinberg VST SDK. If
you are found to be distributing such binaries, you risk both
prosecution by Steinberg and public humiliation by me.

This is not my choice, and as soon as Steinberg change their
licensing, which they have indicated they will do, this policy (and
file) will be removed.

(2) STANDARD TEMPLATES

The templates in ./templates are intended for installation in
$prefix/share/ardour3/templates.
